## How to Use the Monthly Data

All data in the panel is sampled at the end of month $t$; no variables have a lead or a lag.

**Sample start dates:** Most signals have a sample start date of 2002-08, including those that require a rolling estimation period. Signals requiring rolling data use ICE/BofA data to generate observations prior to 2002-08, enabling a consistent start date of 2002-08 for the main panel. Rolling signals that require TRACE-based illiquidity data (e.g., Amihud and Pastor-Stambaugh liquidity betas) start 2003-08.

Several datasets are available on the [Open Bond Asset Pricing](https://openbondassetpricing.com/) website.

### Market Microstructure Adjusted Signals and Returns

The main panel includes several identifiers, additional variables, and signals. As standard, we provide market microstructure-adjusted (MMN) price-based signals, which includes all variables related to bond price, yield, spread, value, illiquidity, within-month risk, and daily betas. The signals employ a minimum 1-business day gap before the month-end price used for returns. The average (median) day gap is 1.68 (1) day. The maximum allowed gap is capped at 10 business days, although this is extremely rare (P99 of the signal gap is 5 days). The methodology is outlined in the [Signal Gap](#signal-gap-for-price-based-signals) section below.

**Main panel usage:** Use month-end returns (`ret_vw`) with the MMN-adjusted signals provided in the main panel.

As an alternative, researchers may access and download the unadjusted (noisy) price-based signals from [openbondassetpricing.com](https://openbondassetpricing.com/). The file is named `mmn_price_based_signals_YYYYmmdd.parquet`; all variables in this file have the suffix `_mmn` (e.g., `ytm_mmn`, `cs_mmn`, `val_hz_mmn`).

**Noisy signals usage:** If using signals from `mmn_price_based_signals_YYYYmmdd.parquet`, you **must** use month-begin returns (`ret_vw_bgn`) to avoid microstructure bias.

Our recommendation is to use the main panel data as provided with `ret_vw`. However, results are extremely similar using either method.

### Excess and Duration-Adjusted Return-Based Signals

The main panel assumes researchers will form factors with excess returns (i.e., using $r^{x} = r - r^{f}$ where `ret_vwx = ret_vw - rfret`). If research designs rely on duration-adjusted returns (i.e., using $r^{x} = r - r^{Tsy}$ where `ret_vwx = ret_vw - tret`), we provide signals specifically computed with duration-adjusted returns. These include all factor betas in `betas_x_2025.parquet` and momentum/long-term reversal variables in `mom_retx_2025.parquet`.

The Treasury return `tret` is the U.S. Treasury bond return that is duration-matched to each corporate bond's modified duration (`md_dur`). For each bond $i$ in each month $t$, we linearly interpolate using key rate U.S. Treasury bond returns from WRDS and the bond's modified duration, following the method of Andreani, Palhares, and Richardson (2024).

The short-term reversal signal can be computed as the current `str` variable minus `tret`. This signal is already MMN-adjusted in the main panel.

### Alternative Month-End Returns

For researchers requiring alternative return measures, we provide `returns_alt_2025.parquet`, which includes:
- `ret_vwp`: Returns computed using par-weighted prices on day $d$
- `ret_ew`: Returns computed using equal-weighted prices on day $d$
- `ret_1st`: Returns computed using the first available trade price on day $d$
- `ret_lst`: Returns computed using the last available trade price on day $d$
- `ret_bid`: Returns computed using the volume-weighted average bid price on day $d$

where day $d$ is in the last 5 business days of months $t$ and $t+1$.

## Signal Definitions

The table below provides definitions for all signals in the database.

**Return-based signals** (betas, momentum, reversals, VaR, ES): We compute both standard and duration-adjusted versions. The duration-adjusted variant uses $r^x = r - r^{Tsy}$ and is stored in `betas_x_2025.parquet` (for all factor betas) and `mom_retx_2025.parquet` (for momentum and long-term reversal signals).

**Price-based signals** (yields, spreads, value, book-to-market, prior 1-month return): All price-based signals in the main panel are market microstructure adjusted (MMN) by default, observed with a minimum 1-business-day gap before the month-end price used for returns. Researchers preferring unadjusted signals can download `mmn_price_based_signals_2025.parquet` from [openbondassetpricing.com](https://openbondassetpricing.com/); all variables in this file have the suffix `_mmn`.

For all signals requiring a rolling window (betas, VaR, ES), we use a 36-month rolling window with a minimum of 12 observations, denoted 36(12). For long-term reversal signals requiring >12 months of history, we use an expanding window that starts at 12-3 and ramps up to the target horizon (e.g., 48-12 or 30-6) to preserve sample coverage.

## Bond Returns

Monthly bond returns are computed from volume-weighted clean prices, accrued interest, and coupon payments. We compute two return types based on the measurement window.

---

### Month-End Return (`ret_vw`)

The month-end return measures performance from the end of month $t$ to the end of month $t+1$:

$$r_{i,t+1}^{End} = \frac{P_{i,t+1} + AI_{i,t+1} + C_{i,t+1}}{P_{i,t} + AI_{i,t}} - 1$$

where:
- $P_{i,t+1}$ = volume-weighted clean price at month-end $t+1$
- $AI_{i,t+1}$ = accrued interest at month-end $t+1$
- $C_{i,t+1}$ = coupon payment during month $t+1$ (if any)

**Validity Criterion:** A month-end return is valid only if the bond trades within the last 5 business days of both month $t$ and month $t+1$ (NYSE calendar).

### Month-Begin Return (`ret_vw_bgn`)

The month-begin return measures performance within a single month, from the beginning to the end:

$$r_{i,t+1}^{Bgn} = \frac{P_{i,t+1}^{end} + AI_{i,t+1}^{end} + C_{i,t+1}}{P_{i,t+1}^{bgn} + AI_{i,t+1}^{bgn}} - 1$$

where:
- $P_{i,t+1}^{end}, AI_{i,t+1}^{end}$ = price and accrued interest from the last 5 business days of month $t+1$
- $P_{i,t+1}^{bgn}, AI_{i,t+1}^{bgn}$ = price and accrued interest from the first 5 business days of month $t+1$

**Validity Criterion:** A month-begin return is valid only if the bond trades within both the first 5 and last 5 business days of month $t+1$ (NYSE calendar).

### Latent Implementation Bias (`lib`)

The **Latent Implementation Bias (LIB)** captures the cost of not being able to trade at the signal observation price.

**Motivation:** A representative trader who observes a price-based signal at the end of month $t$ cannot trade at that exact price. Instead, they must wait until the next trading opportunity—the first available price in month $t+1$. The month-begin return framework accounts for this by using the month-begin price as the entry point.

**LIB** is the clean price return between the signal observation price and the actual execution price:

$$\text{LIB}_{i,t+1} = \frac{P_{i,t+1}^{bgn}}{P_{i,t}} - 1$$

where:
- $P_{i,t}$ = month-end clean price at $t$ (signal observation price, denominator of $r^{End}$)
- $P_{i,t+1}^{bgn}$ = month-begin clean price at $t+1$ (execution price, denominator of $r^{Bgn}$)

```

```

**Interpretation:**
- **LIB > 0**: Price rose between signal observation and execution (adverse move for buyers)
- **LIB < 0**: Price fell between signal observation and execution (favorable move for buyers)
- Month-begin returns remove LIB, providing a cleaner measure of implementable returns

| `libd` | Latent Implementation Bias Dirty: uses dirty prices (includes accrued interest) |

### Signal Gap for Price-Based Signals

The **Signal Gap** addresses market microstructure noise in price-based signals. When forming portfolios based on signals derived from bond prices (yields, spreads, value measures), using the same price for both the signal and the return denominator introduces a mechanical relationship that can bias results.

To address this, we compute price-based signals using prices observed **at least 1 business day before** the month-end price used for returns. The variable `sig_gap` records the number of business days between signal observation (`sig_dt`) and the month-end price date (`dt_e`).

**MMN-adjusted signals in main panel:** The following variables are computed with the 1–10 BD signal gap and are provided as standard in the main TRACE panel downloads:

| Category | Variables |
|----------|-----------|
| Yields & Spreads | `ytm`, `md_dur`, `convx`, `cs`, `dcs6` |
| Value | `bbtm`, `val_hz`, `val_hz_dts`, `val_ipr`, `val_ipr_dts` |
| Size | `sze` |
| Short-term Reversal | `str` |
| Illiquidity | `pi`, `ami`, `ami_v`, `lix`, `ilq`, `roll`, `spd_abs`, `spd_rel`, `cs_sprd`, `ar_sprd`, `p_zro`, `p_fht`, `vov` |
| Within-Month Risk | `dvol`, `dskew`, `dkurt`, `dvol_sys`, `dvol_idio`, `rvol`, `rsj`, `rsk`, `rkt` |
| Within-Month Betas | `db_mkt`, `b_vix`, `b_dvixd` |

**Usage with main panel:** Use month-end returns (`ret_vw`) with the MMN-adjusted signals above.

**Noisy versions available separately:** The unadjusted (noisy) versions of all signals above are provided in `mmn_price_based_signals_YYYYmmdd.parquet` with the `_mmn` suffix (e.g., `ytm_mmn`, `cs_mmn`, `val_hz_mmn`, `ami_mmn`, etc.).

**Usage with noisy signals:** If using signals from `mmn_price_based_signals_YYYYmmdd.parquet`, you **must** use month-begin returns (`ret_vw_bgn`) to avoid microstructure bias. Both methods produce similar results.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `sig_dt` | Date when price-based signal was observed (minimum 1 BD before `dt_e`) |
| `sig_gap` | Business days between signal observation and month-end price; ranges 1–10 BD |

---

### The Three Approaches

We compare portfolio performance using three approaches that differ in signal timing and return measurement:

**Approach 1: With Noise.**
Uses the month-end price $P_t^{\text{end}}$ in *both* the signal and return computation. Portfolio weights $\omega_t$ are computed from signals observed at $P_t^{\text{end}}$, and returns are the standard month-end returns $r_{t+1}^{\text{End}}$. This creates mechanical correlation between signal and return, potentially biasing factor performance upward.

**Approach 2: Adjusted Signal (Default in Main Panel).**
Uses signals computed with at least a 1-business day gap before $P_t^{\text{end}}$, breaking the mechanical correlation. Portfolio weights $\omega_t^{a}$ are computed from gapped signals at $P_{t-\Delta}^{s}$ where $\Delta \geq 1$ BD (max 10 BD). Returns remain the standard month-end returns $r_{t+1}^{\text{End}}$.

**Approach 3: Adjusted Return.**
Uses the same signal timing as Approach 1, but returns are computed from month-begin to month-end within month $t+1$. Portfolio weights $\omega_t$ are computed from $P_t^{\text{end}}$, but returns are the month-begin returns $r_{t+1}^{\text{Bgn}}$. This captures the *implementable* return for a trader observing a signal at month-end.

```
                    THE THREE APPROACHES
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Approach 1: With Noise (Baseline)
   ─────────────────────────────────
   Signal:  P_t^{end}     ────►  ω_t
   Return:  r_{t+1}^{End}
   Issue:   Same price in signal and return denominator

   Approach 2: Adjusted Signal (Main Panel Default)
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Signal:  P_{t-Δ}^{s}   ────►  ω_t^a    (Δ ≥ 1 BD, max 10 BD)
   Return:  r_{t+1}^{End}
   Fix:     Signal observed before return price

   Approach 3: Adjusted Return
   ───────────────────────────
   Signal:  P_t^{end}     ────►  ω_t
   Return:  r_{t+1}^{Bgn}
   Fix:     Implementable return (trade at month-begin)
```

**Note:** Approaches 2 and 3 are both "cleaned" of microstructure noise, while Approach 1 is noisy. The main panel uses Approach 2 by default.

---

### Feasibility Bias

The **Feasibility Bias** quantifies the inflation in factor performance due to market microstructure noise. We compute two bias measures:

**Bias (1)−(2): Signal Adjustment.**

$$\text{Bias}_{1-2} = (\omega_t - \omega_t^{a}) \times r_{t+1}^{\text{End}}$$

This measures the bias from using different weights (noisy vs. gapped signal) while holding the return constant.

**Bias (1)−(3): Return Adjustment.**

$$\text{Bias}_{1-3} = \omega_t \times (r_{t+1}^{\text{End}} - r_{t+1}^{\text{Bgn}})$$

This measures the bias from using the same weights but different returns (month-end vs. month-begin).

**Interpretation:**
- Positive bias indicates the noisy approach (Approach 1) overstates factor performance
- The magnitude of bias varies by signal type—price-based signals (value, spreads) typically show larger bias than return-based signals (momentum, betas)
- Both bias measures should be small for well-constructed factors

---

### Excess and Duration-Adjusted Returns

Users can compute adjusted returns from the variables in the main panel:

**Excess returns** remove the risk-free rate:

$$r_{i,t+1}^{x} = r_{i,t+1} - r_{t+1}^{f}$$

Compute as: `ret_vw - rfret` (month-end) or `ret_vw_bgn - rfret` (month-begin)

**Duration-adjusted returns** remove systematic interest rate exposure by subtracting the return on a duration-matched U.S. Treasury bond:

$$r_{i,t+1}^{x} = r_{i,t+1} - r_{i,t+1}^{Tsy}$$

Compute as: `ret_vw - tret` (month-end) or `ret_vw_bgn - tret` (month-begin)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `tret` | Duration-matched U.S. Treasury return; linearly interpolated from WRDS key rate Treasury returns using bond modified duration (`md_dur`) |
| `rfret` | Monthly risk-free rate from Fama-French |

---

## Defaulted Bond Returns

When bonds enter or trade under default, coupon payments cease and the return formulas are adjusted accordingly. Default status is determined by credit ratings.

### Default Identification

We use the raw agency rating variables to identify default status:

| Rating Agency | Variable | Default Level |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| S&P | `sp_rat` | 22 |
| Moody's | `mdy_rat` | 21 |

**A bond is considered in default if:**
- `sp_rat == 22` **OR** `mdy_rat == 21`

---

### Standard Return (Non-Default)

For bonds not in default, we use the standard total return formula with dirty prices:

$$r_{i,t+1}^{std} = \frac{P_{i,t+1}^{dirty} + C_{i,t+1} - P_{i,t}^{dirty}}{P_{i,t}^{dirty}}$$

where $P^{dirty} = P^{clean} + AI$ (clean price plus accrued interest).

```

### Default Event Return

When a bond **transitions INTO default**, coupon payments cease immediately. The return compares the clean price at default to the prior dirty price:

$$r_{i,t+1}^{def} = \frac{P_{i,t+1}^{clean} - P_{i,t}^{dirty}}{P_{i,t}^{dirty}}$$

### Trading Under Default (Flat Return)

When a bond **remains in default**, there are no coupon accruals. Returns are based solely on clean price changes:

$$r_{i,t+1}^{flat} = \frac{P_{i,t+1}^{clean}}{P_{i,t}^{clean}} - 1$$

```

### Default Return Summary

| Return Type | Condition | Formula | `ret_type` |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Standard | Not in default | $(P_{t+1}^{dirty} + C_{t+1} - P_t^{dirty}) / P_t^{dirty}$ | `standard` |
| Default Event | Enters default | $(P_{t+1}^{clean} - P_t^{dirty}) / P_t^{dirty}$ | `default_evnt` |
| Trading Under Default | Remains in default | $P_{t+1}^{clean} / P_t^{clean} - 1$ | `trad_in_def` |

**Note:** The same logic applies to both month-end (`ret_vw`) and month-begin (`ret_vw_bgn`) returns.

## Technical Appendix

This appendix provides detailed methodology for factor models, beta estimation, and signal computation.

---

### Factor Models

Rolling betas are estimated using a 36-month rolling window with a minimum of 12 observations. For each factor model, betas are computed twice:

1. **Standard returns** (`ret_vw`): Value-weighted bond returns
2. **Duration-adjusted returns** (`ret_vwx`): `ret_vwx = ret_vw - tret`

where `tret` is the matched Treasury return based on bond duration.

### Duration-Adjusted Factor Substitution

When computing betas with duration-adjusted returns (`ret_vwx`), bond market factors are replaced with their duration-adjusted equivalents:

| Standard Factor | Duration-Adjusted Factor |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| `mktb` | `mktbx` |
| `drf` | `drfx` |
| `crf` | `crfx` |
| `lrf` | `lrfx` |

---

### Estimation Methodology

#### Rolling OLS Regression

For each bond $i$ at time $t$, betas are estimated using a rolling window:

$$r_{i,s} = \alpha_i + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \beta_{i,k} F_{k,s} + \varepsilon_{i,s}, \quad s \in [t-W+1, t]$$

where:
- $r_{i,s}$ = bond return (ret_vw or ret_vwx)
- $F_{k,s}$ = factor $k$ at time $s$
- $W$ = window size (36 months)
- Minimum observations = 12

#### Idiosyncratic Volatility

$$\text{ivol} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{s} \hat{\varepsilon}_{i,s}^2}{n - K - 1}}$$

where $n$ is the number of observations and $K$ is the number of factors.

### Momentum and Reversal Signals

All momentum and reversal signals are computed from monthly bond returns. Signals follow the L-S convention: sum returns from month $t-L+1$ to $t-S$ (skipping the most recent $S$ months).

#### Standard Momentum

Cumulative past returns over various horizons (Gebhardt, Hvidkjaer & Swaminathan, 2005):

$$\text{mom}_{L,S} = \sum_{s=S}^{L-1} r_{i,t-s}$$

| Variable | Formula | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `mom3_1` | $\sum_{s=1}^{2} r_{t-s}$ | 3-month momentum, skip 1 |
| `mom6_1` | $\sum_{s=1}^{5} r_{t-s}$ | 6-month momentum, skip 1 |
| `mom9_1` | $\sum_{s=1}^{8} r_{t-s}$ | 9-month momentum, skip 1 |
| `mom12_1` | $\sum_{s=1}^{11} r_{t-s}$ | 12-month momentum, skip 1 |

#### Intermediate Momentum

Momentum computed from months 7-12, excluding recent returns (Novy-Marx, 2012):

$$\text{mom12-7}_{i,t} = \sum_{s=7}^{11} r_{i,t-s}$$

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `mom12_7` | Intermediate momentum (months 7-12) |

#### Systematic and Idiosyncratic Momentum

Decomposes total momentum into market-driven and bond-specific components using residuals from a rolling factor model (Blitz, Huij & Martens, 2011):

**Methodology:** At each month $t$ with valid rolling OLS estimates ($\alpha_t$, $\beta_t$):

1. **Fitted values**: $\hat{r}_s = \alpha_t + \beta_t \cdot F_s$ for each $s$ in the rolling window
2. **Systematic momentum**: $\sum_{s=S}^{L-1} \hat{r}_{t-s}$ (sum of fitted values)
3. **Idiosyncratic momentum**: $\sum_{s=S}^{L-1} (r_{t-s} - \hat{r}_{t-s})$ (sum of residuals)

Key: Uses **current** $\alpha_t$, $\beta_t$ to compute fitted values for all positions.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `sysmom3_1` | Systematic 3-1 momentum |
| `sysmom6_1` | Systematic 6-1 momentum |
| `sysmom12_1` | Systematic 12-1 momentum |
| `idimom3_1` | Idiosyncratic 3-1 momentum |
| `idimom6_1` | Idiosyncratic 6-1 momentum |
| `idimom12_1` | Idiosyncratic 12-1 momentum |

Default factor: `mktb` (bond market excess return). For duration-adjusted returns, uses `mktbx`.

#### Long-Term Reversal

Cumulative past returns over longer horizons, excluding recent months:

**Primary measure** (Bali, Subrahmanyam & Wen, 2021):

$$\text{ltr48-12}_{i,t} = \sum_{s=12}^{47} r_{i,t-s}$$

**Alternative windows** (Subrahmanyam, 2023):

| Variable | Formula | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ltr48_12` | $\sum_{s=12}^{47} r_{t-s}$ | 48-month LTR, skip 12 |
| `ltr30_6` | $\sum_{s=6}^{29} r_{t-s}$ | 30-month LTR, skip 6 |
| `ltr24_3` | $\sum_{s=3}^{23} r_{t-s}$ | 24-month LTR, skip 3 |

#### Industry Momentum and Reversal

Cross-bond momentum spillovers within the same industry (Wang, Wu & Yang, 2024). For each bond, computes the equal-weighted average momentum/reversal of other bonds in the same industry:

$$\text{imom}_{i,t} = \frac{1}{N_{ind}-1} \sum_{j \in \text{ind}(i), j \neq i} \text{mom}_{j,t}$$

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `imom1` | Industry momentum (1-month) |
| `imom3_1` | Industry momentum (3-1) |
| `imom12_1` | Industry momentum (12-1) |
| `iltr48_12` | Industry long-term reversal (48-12) |
| `iltr30_6` | Industry long-term reversal (30-6) |
| `iltr24_3` | Industry long-term reversal (24-3) |

#### Short-Term Reversal and Risk Measures

Downside risk measures computed from daily returns within the month (Bai, Bali & Wen, 2019):

**Short-Term Reversal:**

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `str` | Short-term reversal (past month return) |

**Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall:**

$$\text{VaR}_\alpha = -F^{-1}(\alpha)$$

$$\text{ES}_\alpha = -\mathbb{E}[r \mid r < -\text{VaR}_\alpha]$$

where $F^{-1}$ is the empirical quantile function of daily returns within the month.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `var_90` | 90% Value-at-Risk (10th percentile loss) |
| `var_95` | 95% Value-at-Risk (5th percentile loss) |
| `es_90` | 90% Expected Shortfall (mean of worst 10% returns) |

---

### Value Signals

Value signals measure the deviation of observed credit spreads from "fair" spreads implied by bond characteristics. All regressions use log spreads following Gilchrist & Zakrajšek (2012).

#### Monthly Cross-Sectional Spread Regression

For each month $t$, estimate:

$$\log(cs_{i,t}) = x_{i,t}^\top \beta_t + \varepsilon_{i,t}$$

where $x_{i,t}$ includes rating controls, industry dummies, time-to-maturity, spread changes, and other characteristics. The fitted "fair" spread uses a lognormal retransformation:

$$\widehat{cs}_{i,t} = \exp\left(x_{i,t}^\top \widehat{\beta}_t + \tfrac{1}{2}\widehat{\sigma}_t^2\right)$$

#### Houweling & Van Zundert (2017) Value

Percentage deviation from fitted spread:

$$\text{val-hz}_{i,t} = \frac{cs_{i,t} - \widehat{cs}_{i,t}}{\widehat{cs}_{i,t}}$$

**Controls:** Rating dummies, FF17 industry dummies, maturity, 3-month spread change, call indicator.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `val_hz` | Value signal (% deviation from fair spread) |
| `val_hz_dts` | Value signal with DtS adjustment |

#### Israel, Palhares & Richardson (2018) Value

Log-spread residual from fair-value regression:

$$\text{val-ipr}_{i,t} = \log(cs_{i,t}) - x_{i,t}^\top \widehat{\beta}_t$$

**Controls:** Numeric rating, FF17 industry dummies, log duration, excess return volatility, call indicator.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `val_ipr` | Value signal (log-spread residual) |
| `val_ipr_dts` | Value signal with DtS adjustment |

#### DtS Risk Adjustment

The Duration-times-Spread (DtS) adjustment removes common variation among bonds with similar spread-duration exposure (Israel, Palhares & Richardson, 2018).

**Step 1:** Compute duration-times-spread: $DtS_{i,t} = dur_{i,t} \times cs_{i,t}$

**Step 2:** Assign to quintiles $Q_{i,t} \in \{1,\ldots,5\}$ based on cross-sectional DtS distribution.

**Step 3:** Demean within (month, quintile):

$$val^{dts}_{i,t} = val_{i,t} - \bar{val}_{t,Q_{i,t}}$$

This isolates bond-specific value after controlling for systematic variation in spread-duration risk.

### Illiquidity Measures

All illiquidity measures are computed at the bond-month level from daily TRACE data. Each measure has two versions:
- **Full-sample**: Uses all trades in the month
- **Adjusted**: Excludes the last trade of each month to avoid end-of-month effects

Minimum observation requirement: 5 valid daily observations per bond-month (configurable).

#### Price Impact (PI)

Pastor & Stambaugh (2003) liquidity measure based on return reversals. The coefficient $\gamma$ captures the price impact of signed order flow:

**Regression:**
$$r^e_{i,t+1} = \theta + \psi \cdot r_{i,t} + \gamma \cdot \mathrm{sign}(r^e_{i,t}) \cdot Q_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}$$

where:
- $r^e_{i,t} = r_{i,t} - \bar{r}_t$ is the bond's excess return over the market index
- $Q_{i,t}$ is trading volume at day $t$

**Output:** `pi` $= -\gamma$ (negated so higher values indicate more illiquidity)

#### Amihud Illiquidity (AMI)

Price impact per unit of trading volume (Amihud, 2002).

$$\text{ami}_{i,m} = \frac{1}{N_m} \sum_{t=1}^{N_m} \frac{|r_{i,t}|}{\text{dvol}_{i,t}}$$

**Outputs:**
- `ami`: Monthly mean of daily Amihud ratios
- `ami_v`: Monthly standard deviation of daily Amihud ratios

#### LIX (Liquidity Index)

Combines trading volume and price range into a single liquidity measure (Danyliv, Bland & Nicholass, 2014).

$$\text{lix}_{i,t} = \log_{10}\left(\frac{V_{i,t} \cdot P^{close}_{i,t}}{P^{high}_{i,t} - P^{low}_{i,t}}\right)$$

Monthly `lix` is the mean of daily values.

#### Roll Spread (ILQ, ROLL)

Implicit bid-ask spread from return autocovariance (Roll, 1984).

$$\text{ilq}_{i,m} = -\text{Cov}(\ln(1+r_{i,t}), \ln(1+r_{i,t-1}))$$

$$\text{roll}_{i,m} = \begin{cases} 2\sqrt{\text{ilq}_{i,m}} & \text{if } \text{ilq}_{i,m} > 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

**Outputs:**
- `ilq`: Negative autocovariance of log returns (scaled by 100)
- `roll`: Roll effective spread estimate

#### Hong-Warga Spreads (SPD_ABS, SPD_REL)

Volume-weighted bid-ask spreads using quoted prices.

$$P^{bid}_m = \frac{\sum_t w_t \cdot P^{bid}_t}{\sum_t w_t}, \quad P^{ask}_m = \frac{\sum_t w_t \cdot P^{ask}_t}{\sum_t w_t}$$

where $w_t = \text{dvol}_t$ (dollar volume weights).

**Outputs:**
- `spd_abs`: Absolute spread $= P^{ask}_m - P^{bid}_m$
- `spd_rel`: Relative spread $= (P^{ask}_m - P^{bid}_m) / \text{mid}_m$

#### Corwin-Schultz Spread (CS_SPRD)

High-low spread estimator using two-day price ranges (Corwin & Schultz, 2012).

$$\beta = [\ln(H_t/L_t)]^2 + [\ln(H_{t-1}/L_{t-1})]^2$$

$$\gamma = \left[\ln\left(\frac{\max(H_t, H_{t-1})}{\min(L_t, L_{t-1})}\right)\right]^2$$

$$\alpha = \frac{\sqrt{2\beta} - \sqrt{\beta}}{3 - 2\sqrt{2}} - \sqrt{\gamma}$$

$$\text{cs}_{i,t} = \frac{2(e^\alpha - 1)}{1 + e^\alpha}$$

Monthly `cs_sprd` is the mean of daily estimates. Negative alphas are set to zero.

#### Abdi-Ranaldo Spread (AR_SPRD)

Closing price spread estimator (Abdi & Ranaldo, 2017).

$$\eta_t = \frac{1}{2}(\ln H_t + \ln L_t)$$

$$s^2 = 4\left[\ln C_t - \frac{1}{2}(\eta_t + \eta_{t-1})\right]^2 - (\eta_t - \eta_{t-1})^2$$

$$\text{ar}_{i,t} = \sqrt{\max(s^2, 0)}$$

Monthly `ar_sprd` is the mean of daily estimates.

#### Zero-Return Proportion (P_ZRO)

Fraction of potential trading days with no valid price (Fong, Holden & Trzcinka, 2017).

$$\text{p-zro}_{i,m} = \frac{B_m - N^{price}_{i,m}}{B_m}$$

where $B_m$ is the number of NYSE business days in month $m$ and $N^{price}_{i,m}$ is the count of days with valid prices.

#### FHT Spread (P_FHT)

Spread estimate derived from the proportion of zero-return days (Fong, Holden & Trzcinka, 2017).

$$\text{p-fht}_{i,m} = 2 \sigma_{i,m} \cdot \Phi^{-1}\left(\frac{1 + \text{p-zro}_{i,m}}{2}\right)$$

where $\sigma_{i,m}$ is the within-month return volatility and $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse standard normal CDF.

#### Volatility of Volume (VOV)

Liquidity proxy combining return volatility and trading volume (Tobek, 2016).

$$\text{vov}_{i,m} = 2.5 \cdot \frac{\sigma_{i,m}^{0.60}}{\bar{V}_{i,m}^{0.25}}$$

where $\sigma_{i,m}$ is the standard deviation of daily returns and $\bar{V}_{i,m}$ is the mean daily dollar volume.

### Within-Month Risk Statistics

Computed from daily returns within each bond-month $m$. Uses the cross-sectional mean of daily bond returns as the market factor.

**Data Requirements:** All within-month statistics require:

1. **Minimum observations:** $N_{i,m} \geq 5$ valid daily returns
2. **Valid return criterion:** A daily return $r_{i,t}$ is valid only if the business-day gap satisfies:
   $$\Delta_{i,t} = \text{BusDays}(t-1, t) \leq 5$$
3. **Calendar:** NYSE trading calendar

These requirements apply to all signals computed from daily data within the month (illiquidity measures, realized moments, within-month betas, etc.).
