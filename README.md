Below is the original README for the [TRACE Data Pipeline](https://github.com/Alexander-M-Dickerson/trace-data-pipeline) project, a comprehensive pipeline for processing TRACE corporate bond transaction data.

The motivation for this fork is to run the pipeline on a SLURM cluster, specifically, [The Unversity of Chicago's Research Computing Center](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/) Midway3 cluster.

This fork modifies the original repository in the following ways:

### `main` Branch

* Logging for the length of time required for each filter in the `clean_trace_data` function. This logging led to the modifications made to the `multiprocess_clean-pull-f1-f1pre-f1post` branch.
* The `run_pipeline.sh` script has been modified as follows:

  1. The disk capacity check has been disabled.
  2. The "qsub" sections have been removed and replaced with "wait" bash commands for the stage 0 and stage 1 dependencies.

* The required `sbatch` file for scheduling on SLURM.

### `multiprocess_clean-pull-f1-f1pre-f1post` Branch

* The `_pull_all_chunks` function pulls all chunk data from WRDS sequentially and exports each chunk to a parquet file.
* The `_f1_proc` function reads the parquet files from above, runs the initial cleaning and Filter 1: Dick-Nielsen, and exports the resulting `trace` DataFrame as a parquet file, individually for each chunk.
* Subsequently, the `clean_trace_data` function reads the parquet files from above, and runs the remaining filters.
* Within the `clean_trace_data` function, multiprocessing is introduced for the pulling of data from WRDS and the Filter 1: Dick-Nielsen, in order to run the processes in parallel. There are 5 CPUs required to take advantage of the multiprocessing, which are allocated as follows:

  1. Initial execution of `run_pipeline.sh`, then focused on the `clean_trace_data` function.
  2. `_pull_all_chunks` function (within the `clean_trace_data` function).
  3. `_f1_proc` function (within the `clean_trace_data` function).
  4. `clean_post_20120206` function (within the `clean_trace_chunk` function which is within the `_f1_proc` function).
  5. `clean_pre_20120206` function (within the `clean_trace_chunk` function which is within the `_f1_proc` function).

* The `run_pipeline.sh` script has been modified as follows:

  1. The disk capacity check has been disabled.
  2. The "qsub" sections have been removed and replaced with "wait" bash commands for the stage 0 and stage 1 dependencies.

* The required `sbatch` file for scheduling on SLURM.
<!-- * Separates the original `run_pipeline.sh` into two scripts: `run_pipeline_stage0_partA.sh` and `run_pipeline_stage0_partB_stage1.sh`, allowing for job dependencies to be set up in the `sbatch` files -->

### Quick Start

Executing the pipeline is as simple as:

1. Login to RCC.
2. Clone the repository to your home directory.
3. Create the `.env` file (example provided in `.env.example`).
4. Create `.pgpass` file for WRDS access, by running:

$ module load python/3.11.9
$ python  
>>> import wrds 
>>> db = wrds.Connection() 
Enter your WRDS username: "username” 
Enter your WRDS password: 
Created WRDS pgpass file 
>>> db.close() 
>>> exit()

5. Change permissions of run_pipeline.sh (if necessary):

$ chmod +x run_pipeline.sh

5. Navigate to the project directory and run:

$ ./submit_trace_pipeline.sh
  
to submit the job to SLURM and execute the pipeline.

# TRACE Data Pipeline (Original README)

A comprehensive, pipeline for processing Enhanced, Standard and 144A TRACE (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) corporate bond transaction data. 
It is apart of the [Open Bond Asset Pricing project](https://openbondassetpricing.com/).
This pipeline implements cleaning procedures and error-correction algorithms to produce *high-quality, reproducible* daily and monthly corporate bond panels from raw TRACE transaction data.
The companion repository is [PyBondLab](https://github.com/GiulioRossetti94/PyBondLab/tree/main/examples) which can be used to form corporate bond asset pricing factors.

## Overview

This is a **three-stage pipeline** for building *clean, reliable and reproducible* TRACE corporate bond datasets. 

### Stage 0: Intraday to Daily Processing  **PUBLIC BETA**
Processes raw intraday TRACE transaction data to clean daily panels. Handles three types of TRACE data:
- **Enhanced TRACE**
- **Standard TRACE**
- **Rule 144A bonds**

**Automated workflow:** Run `./run_pipeline.sh` from the project ROOT to execute the complete multi-stage pipeline with automatic job dependencies. Stage 0 jobs run in parallel, then automatically chain to Stage 1 processing when complete.

**Status:** Public beta - fully functional and ready for testing
**Execution:** WRDS Cloud or your home machine (WRDS subscription required)
**Documentation:** See [stage0/README_stage0.md](stage0/README_stage0.md) and [stage0/QUICKSTART_stage0.md](stage0/QUICKSTART_stage0.md)

### Stage 1: Daily Bond Analytics  **PUBLIC BETA**
Enriches Stage 0 daily panels with comprehensive bond analytics and characteristics:
- **Bond analytics** via QuantLib (duration, convexity, YTM, credit spreads)
- **Credit ratings** from S&P and Moody's with numeric conversions
- **Equity identifiers** equity linkers
- **FISD bond characteristics** (coupon, maturity, issuer, amount outstanding, etc.)
- **Fama-French industry classifications** (17 and 30 industries)
- **Ultra-distressed filters** to flag potentially erroneous prices

**Status:** Public beta - fully functional and ready for testing
**Execution:** WRDS Cloud or your home machine (WRDS subscription required)
**Documentation:** See [stage1/README_stage1.md](stage1/README_stage1.md) and [stage1/QUICKSTART_stage1.md](stage1/QUICKSTART_stage1.md)

### Stage 2: Monthly Panel with Factor Signals  **IN DEVELOPMENT**
Produces a clean, error-corrected monthly panel with dozens of corporate bond signals for asset pricing research:
- 50+ bond characteristic signals
- Credit risk factors
- Liquidity measures
- Momentum and reversal signals
- Carry and value signals
- Ready-to-use for monthly portfolio construction -- see [PyBondLab](https://github.com/GiulioRossetti94/PyBondLab/tree/main/examples)

**Status:** In development
**Release:** Coming soon
**Execution:** WRDS Cloud or your home machine (WRDS subscription required)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- WRDS subscription with access to TRACE, FISD, and ratings data
- Python 3.10 or higher (tested on Python 3.12.11)
- SSH access to WRDS Cloud (or local Python environment)
- `.pgpass` configured for passwordless WRDS authentication

### 3-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
# On WRDS Cloud
ssh <your_wrds_id>@wrds-cloud.wharton.upenn.edu
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Alexander-M-Dickerson/trace-data-pipeline.git
cd trace-data-pipeline
```

**Configure WRDS username and author** (choose one method):

**Option A — Environment variable (recommended):**
```bash
export WRDS_USERNAME="your_wrds_id"
echo 'export WRDS_USERNAME="your_wrds_id"' >> ~/.bashrc  # Make persistent
```

**Option B — Edit `config.py`:**
```bash
nano config.py
# Change: WRDS_USERNAME = os.getenv("WRDS_USERNAME", "your_wrds_id")
# Change: AUTHOR = "Your Name"  # Default is "Open Source Bond Asset Pricing"
```

*Note: Password comes from `.pgpass`, not code.*

2. **Install Stage 1 dependencies:**
```bash
# Stage 0 uses system Python (no installation needed)
# Stage 1 requires additional packages
python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the complete pipeline:**
```bash
chmod +x run_pipeline.sh
./run_pipeline.sh
```

**What happens:**
1. **Pre-stage**: Auto-downloads required data files (Liu-Wu yields, OSBAP linker, FF industries)
2. **Stage 0**: Submits 3 parallel jobs (Enhanced, Standard, 144A TRACE)
3. **Stage 0 Reports**: Auto-generates when all TRACE jobs complete
4. **Stage 1**: Auto-starts after Stage 0 reports finish
5. **Total runtime**: ~7 hours on WRDS Cloud

**Automated features:**
- ✅ Data downloads (no manual wget required)
- ✅ Job dependencies (stages run in correct order)
- ✅ Configuration auto-detection (STAGE0_DATE_STAMP, ROOT_PATH, N_CORES)
- ✅ Centralized settings (`config.py` for shared settings)

### Quick Overview

1. **SSH into WRDS** and zip to scratch space (avoids home directory quota):
   ```bash
   ssh {wrds_username}@wrds-cloud.wharton.upenn.edu
   cd /scratch/{institution}/
   zip -r trace-data-pipeline.zip ~/trace-data-pipeline/
   ```

2. **Download the zip** (from your LOCAL machine):
   ```bash
   scp {wrds_username}@wrds-cloud.wharton.upenn.edu:/scratch/{institution}/trace-data-pipeline.zip "{local_destination}"
   ```

3. **Extract locally**:
   - **Windows**: Right-click → Extract All
   - **Mac**: Double-click the zip file
   - **Linux**: `unzip trace-data-pipeline.zip`

**For detailed instructions** (including Windows GUI options): See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md#download-results-to-your-local-machine)

| Placeholder | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `{wrds_username}` | Your WRDS username | `jsmith` |
| `{institution}` | Your institution's scratch folder | `wharton`, `chicago`, `nyu` |

- ‡Columns marked with double dagger are excluded from the public download to reduce file size
- All `prc_*` prices are in percentage of par (99 = 99% of $1,000 = $990)

### Stage 2 Output (Coming Soon)
Monthly panel with 50+ corporate bond signals ready for asset pricing research.

## Performance

**Expected Runtime (WRDS Cloud):**

Using `./run_pipeline.sh` (complete automated pipeline from ROOT):
- **Stage 0 - Data processing** (parallel): ~4-8 hours
  - Enhanced TRACE: ~4 hours
  - Standard TRACE: ~30-60 minutes
  - 144A TRACE: ~30-60 minutes
- **Stage 0 - Report generation**: ~30-60 minutes (waits for all three datasets)
- **Stage 1 - Bond analytics**: ~2 hours (waits for Stage 0 reports)
- **Total**: ~7 hours for complete pipeline (Stage 0 + Stage 1)

**How it works:**
The script uses SGE's `-hold_jid` feature to create automatic dependency chains:
1. Stage 0: Three data extraction jobs run in parallel
2. Stage 0: Report job waits until all three extraction jobs complete
3. Stage 1: Analytics job waits until Stage 0 reports complete
4. All jobs submitted with a single command from ROOT

**Resource Usage:**
- **Stage 0:**
  - Memory: ~4-8GB per job (with default chunk_size=250)
  - Disk: ~1-2GB per dataset (Parquet format)
  - Parallel execution: All three datasets can run simultaneously
- **Stage 1:**
  - Memory: 24GB RAM required in WRDS (specified in run_stage1.sh as `#$ -l m_mem_free=24G`)
  - Processing time: 2-6 hours depending on dataset size and parallel cores
